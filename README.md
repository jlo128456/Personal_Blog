## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes `npm`)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Install Dependencies**:

To install all the necessary packages, including Webpack and its plugins, run the following command:

```bash
npm install

## Using Webpack

Webpack is used to bundle the JavaScript files and manage project dependencies.

### Installing Webpack

Webpack and Webpack CLI are already included in the project's `package.json`. To install them, just run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

### Webpack Configuration

The `webpack.config.js` file is pre-configured to bundle the JavaScript files and handle environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const Dotenv = require('dotenv-webpack');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/main.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    plugins: [
        new Dotenv()
    ],
};
### Running Webpack

To bundle the JavaScript files, use the following command:

```bash
npx webpack --mode development
This will generate the bundled bundle.js file in the dist directory.
